# 🧱 Dungeon Crawler – Data Structures Final Project (C++)

## 🧠 Overview
This project was built as the final assignment for my CSCI 2270 Data Structures course. The goal was to implement the backend logic for a dungeon crawler-style game, using key data structures such as graphs, hash tables, and heaps. While class definitions were provided, I was responsible for designing and implementing core components of the game, including the map traversal system, character inventory management, and battle prioritization logic.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- C++
- Visual Studio Code
- Git / GitHub

## ⚙️ Key Features
- **Dungeon Map (Graph)**: The game world is modeled as a weighted graph where each vertex is a character, and edge weights are based on the strength of the character’s strongest weapon.
- **Character Storage (Hash Table)**: Characters are stored using a hash table with linked list chaining for collision resolution.
- **Inventory System (Max Heap)**: Each character's inventory is managed by a max heap to ensure the strongest weapon is always easily accessible.
- **Battle Logic**: Uses a priority queue to decide the order of character encounters and simulate turn-based combat.
